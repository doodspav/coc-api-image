# coc-api-image
This repo lets you generate a image of someone's main base profile in clash of clans using their #.

Uses the clash of clans api - get an api key at https://developer.clashofclans.com/

Tutorial
------
Use python 2.7 (might work with 3 but not tested)

Using git:

    $ git clone http://github.com/doodspav/coc-api-image
 
Python packages:

    $ pip install numpy
    $ pip install pillow

You will need to get an api key from https://developer.clashofclans.com/.

Bear in mind that api keys are IP specific.

Put the api key in the api_key variable in main_profile.py on line 10.
